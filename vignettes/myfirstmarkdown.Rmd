Patients were given treatment 1 day a week for 10 weeks. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/.D")
```





## Key Results

There were `r nrow(study_df)` patients in the clinical trial. Of these, `r sum(study_df$sex == "f")` were female. The median age of the patients was `r median(study_df$age)` and the standard deviation was `r round(sd(study_df$age), 2)`.

The primary measure of treatment success was defined as patients who indicated that their quality of life had significantly improved as a result of treatment. Across all conditions, `r sum(study_df$success)` patients were successes.

## Analyses

The full dataset contains data from `r nrow(ACTG175)` patients. For each patient, there are `r ncol(ACTG175) - 1` observations (i.e., columns in the data). Table 1 shows the first 5 rows, and first 5 colums of the full dataset.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(ACTG175[1:5, 1:5], caption = "Table 1: First 5 rows and 5 columns of the full ACTG175 dataset")
```

One of the primary measures was the number of days until a major negative event. Across all patients, the median number of days was `r mean(ACTG175$days)`. However, the results did differ between treatment arms. Summary statistics of the number of days, separated by each treatment arm, are presented in Table 2:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tbl2 <- ACTG175 %>% 
  group_by(arms) %>% 
  summarise(
    N = n(),
    Mean = mean(days),
    Median = median(days),
    SD = sd(days),
    Max = max(days)
)

knitr::kable(tbl2, caption = "Summary statistics of the number of days until a major negative event for different treatment arms.")
```





<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


A plot showing the relationship between treatment arm and number of days until a major negative event are presented in Figure 2:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.cap = "Figure 2: Number of days until a major negative event separted by treatment arm"}
ggplot(data = ACTG175, mapping = aes(x = factor(arms), y = days)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Treatment Arm",
       y = "Number of days until a major negative event",
       title = "ACTG175",
       subtitle = "Created within an RMarkdown Document!",
       caption = "Source: speff2trial R package") + 
  theme_bw()
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
