## Study

ACTG175 was a randomized clinical trial to compare monotherapy with *zidovudine* or *didanosine* with combination therapy with zidovudine and didanosine or zidovudine and *zalcitabine* in adults infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type I whose CD4 T cell counts were between 200 and 500 per cubic millimeter.

## Data

In R, the data is stored as ACTG175. The data originally come from the `speff2trial` package. However, for demonstration purposes, the analyses in this document are conducted from a copy of the dataset saved as text file ACTG175.csv on http://therbootcamp.github.io. The analyses in this document are based on this text file.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
